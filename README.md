Airbnb Property Insights & Pricing Recommendation for Hosts in Bangkok

A. Background

Airbnb is a sharing economy platform that acts as an intermediary between property owners (hosts) and renters (guests). The platform provides digital infrastructure to facilitate property discovery, booking, payment and reviews. Hosts list their properties, set prices, and manage availability, while Airbnb takes a commission from each transaction. This model has changed the way people access lodging by providing an alternative to traditional hotels, especially for travelers looking for a more local and flexible experience.

B. Problem Statement

Bangkok is one of the favorite tourist destinations visited by many world tourists. The presence of Airbnb in the city of Bangkok can support the economy and tourism. To support this progress in the future, Airbnb hosts can maximize or increase the potential of their properties based on location, room type and various other conditions so that they can produce competitive price benchmarks.

Therefore, as a data analyst, we will try to answer the following question: ""How can Airbnb hosts in Bangkok set optimal prices based on room type and neighborhood?"

Along with the development of tourism, it is possible that many new Airbnb hosts will offer their properties. This guide will be useful for evaluating competitive prices for existing hosts or as a benchmark for new Airbnb hosts.
